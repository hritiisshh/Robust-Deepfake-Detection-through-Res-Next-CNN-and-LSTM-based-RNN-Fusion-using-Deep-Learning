# Robust-Deepfake-Detection-through-Res-Next-CNN-and-LSTM-based-RNN-Fusion-using-Deep-Learning
We propose a novel methodology for deep learning in view of an emerging challenge to efficiently distinguish these AI-generated fake videos from real ones.At the core of our  system lies a Res- Next CNN extracting frame-level features.
